I am Ms.Utkarsha Chaudhari and I am from Mumbai, India. Having completed my undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering from Savitribai Phule Pune University, I came to CU-ICAR to fuel my passion for automobiles with in-dept technical knowledge.

I have worked for Mercedes Benz Research and Development India as an intern in the interior design team after which I was working with RLE International GmbH which is a German automotive supplier. My responsibilities at RLE were pretty exciting as I was the only sales person in India responsible for German sales. This gave me an opportunity to interact with the C level executives of prominent OEMs and Tier-1 companies.
